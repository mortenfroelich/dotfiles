# dotfiles
Simply a repo for my dotfiles

I owe a great debt to many of the great dotfiles found here on github but especially from [Aaron Bieber](https://www.github.com/aaronbieber) and [Jess Frazelle](https://www.github.com/jessfraz).

Thank you everyone for sharing your work on your personal configurations!
