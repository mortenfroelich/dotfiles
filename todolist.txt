move gitconfig from laptop
add license and contribution info
mount nas in fstab, probably using smb.. requires cifs
fix fans
clean up packages
look at slim as login manager
make a final call between gnome and kde.. start trying without.. vim-gtk3 for gnome vim-gtk2 for kde
update firefox, script perhaps
fix vim?! vim+gtk gives vim load error
setup status, make it specific for desktop/laptop.. add volume, samba mounted, remove ipv6 wireless, battery, memory?
